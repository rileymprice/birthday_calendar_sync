# birthday_calendar_sync
I have always been upset when I find out that a friend of mine has a birthday today at 10 PM because I just so happened to look at my calendar, or even worse realize it a few days after. After a LOT of goolging, I have found that for some reason Google has decided to not allow for notifications from contact calendar. Due to this, I have decided to build it myself!

Thanks to the power of python, I am syncing a custom "Birthday Calendar" with my "Contacts Calendar" in order to allow for notifications to happen. 


Posisble next step to automate a text to each of those people??? More to come :D
